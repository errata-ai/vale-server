The `.vale.ini` file is where you'll control the majority of Vale's behavior,
including what files to lint and how to lint them.

Each ini file has global settings and settings that apply to specific file types.

```ini title=".vale.ini"
# Example Vale config file (`.vale.ini` or `_vale.ini`)

# Core settings
StylesPath = "ci/vale/styles"

# Define the exceptions to use in *all* `BasedOnStyles`.
Vocab = Some-Name

# The minimum alert level to display (suggestion, warning, or error).
#
# CI builds will only fail on error-level alerts.
MinAlertLevel = warning

# The "formats" section allows you to associate an "unknown" format
# with one of Vale's supported formats.
[formats]
mdx = md

# Global settings (applied to every file type)
[*]
# List of styles to load
BasedOnStyles = write-good, Joblint
# Style.Rule = {YES, NO} to enable or disable a specific rule
vale.Editorializing = YES
# You can also change the level associated with a rule
vale.Hedging = error

# File type-specific settings
# These overwrite any conflicting global settings
[*.{md,txt}]
vale.Editorializing = NO
```

:::note Heads up!
You can override the default search process by  manually specifying a path using
the [`--config`](/vale/cli#--config) option.

For example, if you'd like to use the XDG standard, you can reference the
relevant environment variable:

```bash
$ vale --config "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vale/vale.ini"
```

:::

Vale expects its configuration to be in a file named `.vale.ini` or `_vale.ini`.
It'll start looking for this file in the same directory as the file that's
being linted. If it can't find one, it'll search up to 6 levels up the
directory tree. After 6 levels, it'll look for a global configuration file in the OS equivalent of `$HOME` \(see below\).

| OS | Search Locations |
| :--- | :--- |
| Windows | `$HOME`, `%UserProfile%`, or `%HomeDrive%%HomePath%` |
| macOS | `$HOME` |
| Linux | `$HOME` |

If more than one configuration file is present, the closest one takes precedence.

## Core

### `StylesPath`

```ini
# Here's an example of a relative path:
#
# .vale.ini
# ci/
# ├── vale/
# │   ├── styles/
StylesPath = "ci/vale/styles"
```

`StylesPath` specifies where Vale should look for its external resources
\(e.g., styles and ignore files\). The path value may be absolute or relative
to the location of the parent `.vale.ini` file.

### `Vocab` (<span className="badge badge--secondary">v2.3.0</span>)

```ini
# Define the exceptions to use in *all* `BasedOnStyles`.
Vocab = Some-Name
```

`Vocab` instructs Vale to use a particular, user-defined
["vocabulary"](/vale/vocab) (terms to either accept or reject). This will
automatically apply to all styles listed in `BasedOnStyles`.

`Some-Name` should correspond to a directory located in `<StylesPath>/Vocab`.

### `MinAlertLevel`

```ini
MinAlertLevel = suggestion
```

`MinAlertLevel` specifies the minimum alert severity that Vale will report. The options are "suggestion," "warning," or "error" \(defaults to "suggestion"\).

### `IgnoredScopes`

```ini
# By default, `code` and `tt` are ignored.
IgnoredScopes = code, tt
```

`IgnoredScopes` specifies inline-level HTML tags to ignore. In other words, these tags may occur in an active scope \(unlike `SkippedScopes`, which are _skipped_ entirely\) but their content still won't raise any alerts.

### `IgnoredClasses` (<span className="badge badge--secondary">v2.2.0</span>)

`IgnoredClasses` specifies classes to ignore. These classes may appear on both inline- and block-level HTML elements.

```ini
IgnoredClasses = my-class, another-class
```

### `SkippedScopes`

```ini
# By default, `script`, `style`, `pre`, and `figure` are ignored.
SkippedScopes = script, style, pre, figure
```

`SkippedScopes` specifies block-level HTML tags to ignore. Any content in these scopes will be ignored.

### `WordTemplate`

```ini
WordTemplate = \b(?:%s)\b
```

`WordTemplate` specifies what Vale will consider to be an individual word.

### `SphinxBuildPath` (<span className="badge badge--secondary">v2.0.0</span>)

```ini
SphinxBuildPath = _build
```

`SphinxBuildPath` is the path to your `_build` directory \(relative to the configuration file\).

### `SphinxAutoBuild` (<span className="badge badge--secondary">v2.0.0</span>)

```ini
SphinxAutoBuild = make html
```

`SphinxAutoBuild` is the command that builds your site \(`make html` is the default for Sphinx\).

If this is defined, Vale will re-build your site prior to linting any content -- which makes it possible to use Sphinx and Vale in lint-on-the-fly environments \(e.g., text editors\) at the cost of performance.

## File type-specific settings

The configuration file must include at least one file type-specific section to indicate how Vale treats a certain type of file.
Each of these sections starts with a file type expression in brackets, such as `[*]` to match all files or `[*.{md,txt}]` to match all files that end with `.md` or `.txt`.
Without one of these sections, Vale does not read any files.

At minimum, each file type-specific section must include the `basedOnStyles` setting to specify which styles apply to that file type.

### `BasedOnStyles`

```ini
BasedOnStyles = Joblint, write-good
```

`BasedOnStyles` specifies [styles](/vale/styles) that should have all of their rules enabled.

### `BlockIgnores`

```ini
BlockIgnores = (?s) *({< file [^>]* >}.*?{</ ?file >})
```

`BlockIgnores` allow you to exclude certain block-level sections of text that don't have an associated HTML tag that could be used with `SkippedScopes`. See [Non-Standard Markup](/vale/scoping#non-standard-markup) for more information.

### `TokenIgnores`

```ini
TokenIgnores = (\$+[^\n$]+\$+)
```

`TokenIgnores` allow you to exclude certain inline-level sections of text that don't have an associated HTML tag that could be used with `IgnoredScopes`. See [Non-Standard Markup](/vale/scoping#non-standard-markup) for more information.

### `Transform` (<span className="badge badge--secondary">v2.0.0</span>)

```ini
Transform = docbook-xsl-snapshot/html/docbook.xsl
```

`Transform` specifies a version 1.0 XSL Transformation \(XSLT\) for converting to HTML. See [Formats\#XML](/vale/scoping#xml-markup) for more information.
